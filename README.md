# Forkify

## What is this?

This is the final project I developed for "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

It's an application to search for yummi recipies! ðŸ˜‹

Built with modern JS (ES6+): Functional (Declarative) Programming, Node Package Manager (NPM), Promises with async/await, modern operators/methods, and more.

## Usage/Build?

1. Install node packages:

```console
$ npm i
```

2. To run locally:

```console
$ npm start
```

3. To build project for deployment:

```console
$ npm run build
```

## Can I see it?
