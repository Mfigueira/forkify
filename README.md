# Forkify

## What is this?

This is the final project I developed for "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

It's an application to search for yummi recipies! ðŸ˜‹

Built with modern JS (ES6+): Functional (Declarative) Programming, Node Package Manager (NPM), Promises with async/await, and more.

## Can I see it?

Yes! It's uploaded [here](https://mfigueira.github.io/forkify/).
